Statements
- -----------

I am transitioning GPG keys. I have no reason to suspect my old keys were ever
compromised, however, moving forward I would like to ensure that remains true.
For that reason have generated new keys on an "airgap," which have been moved to
two Yubikey 4 smartcards. The master key is then kept separate from the subkeys,
and is only used for key signing. Both Yubikeys are protected by both pins and 
require touch of a physical button to perform any cryptographic operation.

For information on how you might do this yourself see:
https://gist.github.com/ageis/5b095b50b9ae6b0aa9bf and
https://github.com/flamsmark/documentation/blob/master/gpg/smartcard-keygen.md.

My old key fingerprint is:

pub   4096R/C3CF3F57 2015-08-16
      Key fingerprint = BA4D 62EA BA8D 66A4 82AE  B923 B85C 3A8A C3CF 3F57

My new key fingerprint is:

pub   4096R/68A6AA0A 2016-01-11
      Key fingerprint = 3E65 947B F6EB 62A9 E707  4BCA C469 22E0 68A6 AA0A

My new key has signed my old key and both keys will be used to sign this
message. Please verify the signatures on this message before trusting its
contents and please ensure the fingerprint of my new key matches the fingerprint
listed herein, was used to sign this message, and has been signed by my old key.

Proof of freshness
